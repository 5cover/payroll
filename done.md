And action buttons : allow and disallow (find better terms)

The warning summary is Like a todo list. you can see information, jump to the line, and allow or disallow it. Once you click, the row is removed. You can still alter your decision later.

### Action buttons

For each warning, there are threes actions:

- Allow
- Cap at max time
- Forbid

What happens when we "allow" a warning?

it's saying "account for the extraenous time in this shift"
